# Object-Detection-with-YOLOv4

<p>Object detection is a task in Computer vision that involves identifying the presence and location of one or more objects in an image or video. The input for this task is an image (or video) and output is the same image but with a bounding box and label identifying the name and location of identified object.</p>

## Data set 
<p>Source of all images used in this project was https://opensource.google/projects/open-images-dataset

## Steps followed in the code book are as follows:
<p>1- Cloning and building a framework
<p>2- Downloading pre-trained object detector (YOLOv4) weights
<p>3- Downloading custom dataset from Google Open Images
<p>4- Converting Open Images annotations to YOLOv4 format
<p>5- Training pre-trained YOLOv4 model on custom data set (Transfer Learning)
<p>6- Making predictions
